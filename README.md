# Traffic-Sign-Classification-Using-Deep-Learning-in-Python-Keras
Traffic Sign Classification project in Python/Keras using deep learning. Trained on the German Traffic Sign Recognition Benchmark dataset, the model achieves over 98% accuracy on test data. Code is well-documented and organized, making it easy to understand and modify. Ideal for self-driving car or traffic sign recognition systems.

This project implements a deep learning model to classify traffic signs from the German Traffic Sign Recognition Benchmark dataset. The model is built using the Keras framework in Python and trained on a GPU for fast performance.

The dataset contains over 50,000 images of 43 different types of traffic signs, including speed limit signs, stop signs, and warning signs. The images vary in lighting conditions, weather, and other factors, making classification challenging.

The model architecture is a convolutional neural network (CNN) with several convolutional and pooling layers followed by fully connected layers. It uses the categorical cross-entropy loss function and the Adam optimizer to train the model.

After training, the model achieves an accuracy of over 98% on the test set, demonstrating its effectiveness in classifying traffic signs. The model is also evaluated on a few real-world images to showcase its practicality.

This project serves as a good starting point for anyone interested in traffic sign classification using deep learning techniques. The code is well-documented and organized, making it easy to understand and modify. Additionally, the trained model can be used in real-world applications such as self-driving cars or traffic sign recognition systems.
